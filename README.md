## Milestones
Milestone 1 (Work In Progress)

### Checkbox.io
Experiences & Difficulties:
- Learnt how to use vault to encrypt the DB passwords
- Since idempotency was needed to be considered, a bit more work was need to make sure of that.
- The ansible copy command did not work as expected when copying files within the remote server in python3. Had to do a workaround with the fetch module to make it work.
- I needed to use pymongo to add users in mongodb with ansible. This was not needed when I manually added the users, but since ansible uses python, I guess this dependency was introduced to interact with MongoDB.


### iTrust
Experiences & Difficulties (Dinesh):
- Learnt how to accepting license noninteractively while installing JDK and mysql
- Learnt how to set up mysql-server without root password (while installing rather than modifying user later)
- I needed to learn more about SIGHUP and how processes run in tty. I was able to start Apache Tomcat server but was unable to keep it in RUNNING state. Later learnt more about tty and NOHUP.
